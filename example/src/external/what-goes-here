Clone these repos:

https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/php-request
https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/php-log
https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/php-pattern-matcher

all you need is their source, nothing more, in layman's terms:

- for php-request you want to remove the "lib/src" part of "lib/src/request" 
	so it reads "request/" and then all classes inside.
- for php-log you want to remove the "src" part of "src/log" so it reads "log/"
	and then all class files inside.
- for php-pattern-matcher you want to remove the "lib/src" part of "lib/src/tools/pattern_matcher"
	so it reads "tools/pattern_matcher/" and then all class files inside.

And that would be all.
